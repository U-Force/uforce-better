9.0 NEUTRON MONITORING SYSTEMS 
 
The neutron monitoring systems monitor the neutron flux level of the reactor core by 
detecting leakage neutrons from the core and by detecting neutron flux levels from 
within the core.  These neutron monitoring functions are satisfied by two completely 
independent neutron monitoring systems.  The excore nuclear instrumentation 
system (Section 9.1) monitors leakage neutrons, while the incore nuclear 
instrumentation system (Section 9.2) monitors the neutron flux level within the core. 
 
The excore system monitors leakage neutrons as a measure of core power and 
provides control and protection inputs to the rod control system and the reactor 
protection system.  The incore system is used periodically to monitor relative core 
power distribution via its movable detector system.  Additionally, the incore 
instrumentation system utilizes thermocouples, located at the outlet of the fuel 
region, to provide a diverse indication of the relative power distribution for the 
operator.
